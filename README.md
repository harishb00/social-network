# Docker
## Docker Image
A Docker image is a read-only template that describes how to create a Docker container. The
image is the instructions while the container is the actual running instance of an image. To
continue our apartment analogy from earlier in the chapter, an image is the blueprint or set
of plans for building an apartment; the container is the actual, fully-built building.

## Dockerfile
 To build our own image we create a special
 file known as a Dockerfile that defines the steps to create and run the custom image

## `.dockerignore`

`docker build .` builds the image. it uses the `Dockerfile` from current directory.

 In order to run the container
 weneed alist of instructions in a file called docker-compose.yml. 

 `docker-compose up` to run docker container

 What does WORKDIR actually mean? creating directory in container

 docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
 docker-compose up 
 docker-compose up -d
 docker-compose down
 docker-compose up-d--build

  docker-compose exec web poetry run python manage.py migrate
 $ docker-compose exec web poetry python manage.py createsuperuser
